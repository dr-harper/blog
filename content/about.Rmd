Itâ€™s my personal mission to drive decarbonisation of the energy industry
by using technology and data to both automate decisions and influence
peopleâ€™s behaviour.

I have expertise in smart home technology, heat pumps, thermal modelling and the energy sector. 

I love being in innovation projects, finding new ways to use data, and turning an idea into reality via proof of concepts. I always aim for a Minimal Viable Product, and integrate a test and learn approach into my work.

**Key Achievements:**

- Led the data science development of a new smart buildings platform.
- Developed a suite of models including occupancy classification, well-being monitoring and heating optimisation. A 20% energy saving was achieved on trial buildings.
- Implemented a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming optimising for Combined Heat and Power plant. Estimated savings suggested Â£1 million can be saved across the full portfolio.
- Worked closely with data engineers to develop data pipelines for migrating existing datasets into the new smart buildings platform.
- Responsible for managing GDPR considerations around potential analytics and led the Data Protection Impact Assessment to ensure mitigation was in place.

**Key Achievements:**

- Analysed Call Detail Records (CDRs) in countries including [Haiti](https://www.flowminder.org/media/wmjpg1li/haiti_digicel_dtm_slide_report_june2020_eng.pdf) to assess changes in mobility patterns caused by COVID-19 lockdown measures in countries.
- Developed web applications for geospatial visualisation and analysis, which were used to engage with non-technical stakeholders.
- Led the development of training sessions to improve organisational coding procedure, including the use of version control and code documentation.
- My biggest learning from this role was the importance of considering the needs of different stakeholders when transitioning research concepts into decision-making tools.

**Key Achievements:**

- Data-driven PhD research has focussed on renewable energy modelling.
- R used extensively within project for data mining, processing, geospatial modelling, statistical analysis and presenting results.
- Developed statistical analysis tools to assess the likelihood of a wind turbine project receiving planning permission.
- Multi-criteria decision analysis tool developed for locating onshore wind turbine considering economic, social and environmental parameters. Findings demonstrate the social limitations to onshore wind turbine development and highlights the impact of these restrictions on further development potential.
- Research presented at two academic conferences in 2017 and published in two journals, both are available open access.
