## About Me

I am a data scientist with a PhD in geospatial renewable energy modelling, with professional experience analysing electricity consumption data. I have a keen personal interest in smart home technology, having built a range of sensors to collect data and automate tasks throughout my home. I am a creative thinker who is proficient at writing efficient code to solve technical challenges and using data visualisation to communicate results, and champion the use of human centred design approaches to ensure projects meet the needs of people.
