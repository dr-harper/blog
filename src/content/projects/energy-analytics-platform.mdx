## Overview

This platform was built to address a fundamental challenge in the renewable energy sector: making sense of the vast quantities of data generated by distributed energy assets. From solar farms to battery storage systems, each asset produces thousands of data points per day that need to be ingested, processed, and surfaced in a way that enables rapid decision-making.

## Architecture

The data pipeline is built on Google Cloud Platform, with Cloud Functions handling real-time ingestion from MQTT brokers and REST APIs. Raw telemetry flows into BigQuery via streaming inserts, where it is transformed through a series of scheduled queries into analytics-ready tables. Terraform manages the entire infrastructure as code, ensuring reproducible deployments across development, staging, and production environments.

## Impact

The platform currently monitors assets across multiple sites in the UK, providing real-time dashboards for operational teams and automated alerting for anomaly detection. Forecasting models built with Prophet and scikit-learn feed into the dashboard layer, giving operators advance notice of expected generation and demand patterns. The result is a measurable improvement in asset utilisation and a reduction in unplanned downtime.
