## 🔄 Why the rewrite?

The previous site was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), which served well for academic-style R Markdown posts. But the tooling aged — Hugo pinned at v0.75, R dependencies bit-rotting, and the theme becoming harder to customise.

The new stack solves all of that:

- ⚡ **Astro 5** — static site generation with zero-JS by default, islands architecture for interactive bits
- ⚛️ **React islands** — interactive components (animated stats, GitHub heatmap, terminal 404, command palette) hydrate only when needed
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS v4** — dark/light theme with CSS custom properties, no config file
- 📝 **MDX** — blog posts with embedded React components where needed
- 🔍 **Pagefind** — static search index built at deploy time, no external service

The 23 blog posts were migrated from `.Rmd`/`.html` to `.mdx`, preserving all R-generated figures and interactive htmlwidgets via iframes.

## ✨ Features

- 🌗 **Dark/light theme** with system preference detection and manual toggle
- 🚄 **Animated Shinkansen landscape** — SVG bullet train with wind turbines, solar panels, power lines, and a house with a heat pump. Sun/moon switches with the theme
- 💀 **Terminal 404** — interactive command-line error page with easter eggs
- ⌨️ **Command palette** (Ctrl+K) — fuzzy search across all pages, posts, and projects
- ⏱️ **Reading time & progress bar** — remark plugin calculates reading time at build, progress bar tracks scroll position
- 📑 **Table of contents** — floating sidebar on wide screens with active section highlighting
- 🔗 **Related posts** — tag-overlap scoring at build time, no external services
- 🖥️ **Blog log view** — terminal-style `tail -f` feed as an alternative to the card grid
- 🟩 **GitHub contribution heatmap** — fetched at build time via GitHub GraphQL API
- 💼 **Career timeline** — interactive git-log-styled work history
- 📡 **RSS feed & sitemap** — auto-generated
