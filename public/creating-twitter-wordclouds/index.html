<p>I recently finished my PhD, and my supervisor, Patrick James, always described me as a “<em>data monster</em>” in reference to how much I enjoyed playing with data. He was a massive influence throughout my PhD, so I felt it was only appropriate to get him a data-related gift when I finished. To this effect, I made him a wordcloud of all his tweet history!</p>
<p>This blog post explains how we can interact with Twitter data in R using the <strong>rtweet</strong> <span class="citation">(Kearney 2018)</span> package, and convert this raw data into pretty visualisations using the <strong>wordcloud2</strong> <span class="citation">(Lang 2018)</span> package. Hopefully it of use to others who may want to replicate the analysis themselves.</p>
<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>There are three key stages to the process of making the wordcloud:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Access the data from Twitter</strong>: this is done via the <strong>rtweet</strong> <span class="citation">(Kearney 2018)</span> package.</li>
<li><strong>Clean and extract the word data</strong>: removing all additional characters, hyperlinks, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Format the wordcloud</strong>: we need to stylise the appearance of the wordcloud.</li>
</ol>
<p>The packages used in the analysis are listed as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rtweet)        # Used for extracting the tweets
library(tm)            # Text mining cleaning
library(stringr)       # Removing characters
library(qdapRegex)     # Removing URLs 
library(wordcloud2)    # Creating the wordcloud</code></pre>
<div id="extracting-tweets" class="section level2">
<h2>Extracting Tweets</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://developer.twitter.com/content/developer-twitter/en.html">Twitter API</a> makes it very easy to download tweet history for a user, a the <strong>rtweet</strong> <span class="citation">(Kearney 2018)</span> package has been developed to provide an interface with this to R. You will need to sign up for a developer account to be able to access the API. From my experience, the process was not overly difficult, but there was almost a three week wait in my application being approved. Once you have an account, you will need to authenticate it with R as <a href="https://github.com/mkearney/rtweet">explained here</a>.</p>
<p>Having setup the package, the tweet history for a user can be extracted using the <code>get_timelines</code> function. This extracts up to 3200 recent tweets from a user and provides lots of metdata for each tweet (date, time, text, links, location etc.). This is shown below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># scrape the tweets
tweets_pab &lt;- get_timelines(c(&quot;pab_james&quot;), n = 3200)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="cleaning-the-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Cleaning the Data</h2>
<p>Once the tweet history has been extracted, it must be formatted and cleaned for the plot. Firstly, the column <code>text</code> is collapsed into a single character vector:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Clean the data
text &lt;- str_c(tweets_pab$text, collapse = &quot;&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We need to clean the text in the string. The <code>str_remove</code> function is used to remove linebreaks, hyperlinks, any hashtags and mentions. We are also not interested in keeping any basic words such as “a”, “the”, “and” etc., so we can use the <code>removeWords</code> and <code>stopwords</code> function from the <strong>tm</strong> <span class="citation">(Feinerer and Hornik 2018)</span> package. In addition, the <strong>qdapRegex</strong> package <span class="citation">(Rinker 2017)</span> is used to strip out the URLs:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># continue cleaning the text
text &lt;- 
  text %&gt;%
  str_remove(&quot;\\n&quot;) %&gt;%                   # remove linebreaks
  rm_twitter_url() %&gt;%                    # Remove URLS
  rm_url() %&gt;%
  str_remove_all(&quot;#\\S+&quot;) %&gt;%             # Remove any hashtags
  str_remove_all(&quot;@\\S+&quot;) %&gt;%             # Remove any @ mentions
  removeWords(stopwords(&quot;english&quot;)) %&gt;%   # Remove common words (a, the, it etc.)
  removeNumbers() %&gt;%
  stripWhitespace() %&gt;%
  removeWords(c(&quot;amp&quot;))                   # Final cleanup of other small changes</code></pre>
<p>Having cleaned the data, we can format the table. The function ‘TermDocumentMatrix’ is used to construct a frequency table of the words from the text string above. This table is sorted by frequency to make it easier to inspect. A quick summary of the most common words is shown in Table <a href="#tab:keywords">1</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Convert the data into a summary table
textCorpus &lt;- 
  Corpus(VectorSource(text)) %&gt;%
  TermDocumentMatrix() %&gt;%
  as.matrix()

textCorpus &lt;- sort(rowSums(textCorpus), decreasing=TRUE)
textCorpus &lt;- data.frame(word = names(textCorpus), freq=textCorpus, row.names = NULL)</code></pre>

<h2>Building the Wordcloud</h2>
<p>Finally, we can build the wordcloud. There are two main options which can be used this: either <strong>wordcloud</strong> or <strong>wordcloud2</strong>. For the example, I have used the <strong>wordcloud2</strong> package <span class="citation">(Lang 2018)</span>, as it offered a few more functions for customising the output. Below, we use the frequency table developed above to create the wordlcloud, as shown in Figure <a href="#fig:wordCloud">1</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># build wordcloud 
wordcloud &lt;- wordcloud2(data = textCorpus, minRotation = 0, maxRotation = 0, ellipticity = 0.6)
wordcloud</code></pre>

Figure 1: Our tweet wordcloud
</p>
</div>
<p>We can play around with this basic setup, and I would recommend checking out the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wordcloud2/vignettes/wordcloud.html">package documentation</a> to see some of the things that can be done. For example, we can provide our own image as a mask to customise the shape of the wordcloud.</p>

<div id="wrapping-it-all-up" class="section level1">
<h1>Wrapping It all up</h1>
<p>If we want to create Wordclouds for multiple users, we can wrap the above code up into a function. Below is the <code>TweetsToWordcloud</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>TweetsToWordcloud &lt;- function(username){
  
  tweets &lt;- get_timelines(username, n = 3200)
  
  # Clean the data
  text &lt;- str_c(tweets$text, collapse = &quot;&quot;) %&gt;%
  str_remove(&quot;\\n&quot;) %&gt;%                   # remove linebreaks
  rm_twitter_url() %&gt;%                    # Remove URLS
  rm_url() %&gt;%
  str_remove_all(&quot;#\\S+&quot;) %&gt;%             # Remove any hashtags
  str_remove_all(&quot;@\\S+&quot;) %&gt;%             # Remove any @ mentions
  removeWords(stopwords(&quot;english&quot;)) %&gt;%   # Remove common words (a, the, it etc.)
  removeNumbers() %&gt;%
  stripWhitespace() %&gt;%
  removeWords(c(&quot;amp&quot;))                   # Final cleanup of other small changes
  
    # Convert the data into a summary table
  textCorpus &lt;- 
    Corpus(VectorSource(text)) %&gt;%
    TermDocumentMatrix() %&gt;%
    as.matrix()
  
  textCorpus &lt;- sort(rowSums(textCorpus), decreasing=TRUE)
  textCorpus &lt;- data.frame(word = names(textCorpus), freq=textCorpus, row.names = NULL)
  
  wordcloud &lt;- wordcloud2(data = textCorpus, minRotation = 0, maxRotation = 0, ellipticity = 0.6)
  return(wordcloud)
}</code></pre>
<p>Then using this function on another example of another one of my academic supervisors:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>TweetsToWordcloud(username = &quot;dataknut&quot;)</code></pre>
