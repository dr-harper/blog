      <description>About I have reflecting on the unprecedented week in the UK. Even this time last week, the country seemed fairly laid back as government advice was largely to continue with business as usual. It is all very different to now, with schools set to close on Monday and most people either working from home or not working at all.
This blog post provides details of anaylsis and data viusalisation to assess the spread of virus, giving three example maps which I have produced.</description>

      <description>As a data analyst, I always get happy when I discover there are great datasets available for interesting and important global events. I make a lot of my own decision making through data, and therefore this data gives me a way to cut through all the media noise which can often be present. This is certainly the case with the COVID-19 outbreak which is currently sweeping the UK media!</description>

      <description>Cover photo by atmtx  rstudio::conf 2019 is sadly over. I can honestly say it was one of the most interesting and educational conferences that I have been to, and I have come back with a long list of ideas which I want to get using right away! Here are some of the key points that I learned this week, with links to useful packages you may want to check out!</description>

      <title>Creating Twitter Wordclouds in R</title>

      <description>I recently finished my PhD, and my supervisor, Patrick James, always described me as a “data monster” in reference to how much I enjoyed playing with data. He was a massive influence throughout my PhD, so I felt it was only appropriate to get him a data-related gift when I finished. To this effect, I made him a wordcloud of all his tweet history!
This blog post explains how we can interact with Twitter data in R using the rtweet (Kearney 2018) package, and convert this raw data into pretty visualisations using the wordcloud2 (Lang 2018) package.</description>

      <description>It was with great pleasure today that I was able to launch the book “A Village Inheritance” with my grandmonther, Clare Court, at Williton Library in Somerset. The event was a culmination of several years of hard work to get the book ready for publishing, and almost 50 years since the book was originally written, the book is available for all to enjoy!
We had no idea how many people would be interested in such an event.</description>

      <description>On Saturday 8th September 2017, I attempted to walk from London to Southampton as part of a charity fundraising event for Cameroon Catalyst. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the whole route, as I had to withdraw due to injury at the 50 mile mark at Basingstoke, but it was an overall fantastic experience which I was proud to undertake.
This blog post aims to capture the enjoyment and pain of undertaking the challenge!</description>

      <title>Animated Plots with R</title>

      <description>Data scientists are blessed with a range of software tools which they can use to visualise results, and provide loads of great ways to present data which is equally informative and visually compelling. The increasing popularity of R ggplot2 (Wickham et al. 2018) has made many people familiar with static plots, but animated plots can be an effective way to communicate results, and there are few better examples than the use of them in the now famous TED talk by Hans Rosling.</description>

      <description>The old cliché goes that “A picture is worth a thousand words”. This may be overused, but I feel this is particularly relevant in data analysis, and we often use diagrams as tools to quickly communicate the results of our complex statistical models. However, whilst we often prioritise on explaining the results of the analysis, we are often less inclined to explain the stages used to reach the results to the same level of detail.</description>

      <description>knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval=FALSE) For my PhD research, I needed to collect local political data for the UK. This article documents the data sources and procedure used to create a suitable dataset for my analysis. This provides a technical overview of the data. The R code used to create the analysis is available through GitHub here.
Setup R was used to run the analysis. The code uses a number of packages to process the data:</description>

      <description>RMarkdown is a powerful tool for producing documents with embedded R code, allowing you to easily reproduce analysis and greatly simplify your data-driven workflow. It can be used to generate dynamic reports, presentations, journal papers, and even your thesis!
The presentation was designed to provide a whistle-stop tour of the benefits of RMarkdown, explaining the basic syntax to get started and highlighting some of the more advance things which you could use RMarkdown for.</description>

      <description>Intro Although R is widely used for data processing and statistical modelling, it is less frequently known for its powers of handing Geospatial Data. This presentation is aimed to highlgiht why people may want to consider using R for their GIS, and highlight some of the benefits of using R in their analyses.
 Why use R for GIS There are many benefits of using R for GIS, but to me the top three reasons would be:</description>

What is the problem? Wind energy provides a key opportunity for the UK government to meet decarbonisation targets. There is wide avaialbility of resource across the country, and onshore wind provides one of the most mature and cost-effective methods to supply renewable electricity.</description>

      <description>Back in May 2016, a friend and I undertook one of the challenges which we had wanted to do for years and cycled the length of the United Kingdom from Land’s End to John O’ Groats. It was a fantastic experience and something I would love to do again one day. This blog provides a summary of our trip and aims to aid anyone who may be planning their own trip.</description>
