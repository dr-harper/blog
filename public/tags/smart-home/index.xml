      <description>I sometimes joke with my wife that she is living in my smart home laboratory, and to be fair she kind of is. Almost every week, I play around with a new product or sensor, or change the way something behaves in my house. Some things have worked, others havenâ€™t, but there is always a lesson to learn (and sometimes a wife to apologise to for annoying).
Anyway, the aim of this blog is to capture some of the top takeways I have from my experiences, and share these to hopefully help others.</description>
