      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was with great pleasure today that I was able to launch the book “&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2zD1eu8&#34;&gt;A Village Inheritance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;” with my grandmonther, Clare Court, at Williton Library in Somerset. The event was a culmination of several years of hard work to get the book ready for publishing, and almost 50 years since the book was originally written, the book is available for all to enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had no idea how many people would be interested in such an event. As I travelled to Somerset this morning, I wouldn’t have expected that almost 30 people would find the time in their days to attend our talk. But we were amazed to see so many people join us, and it was fantastic to be able to share our story of the book with them and share the work of my grandparents with so many people.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
