      <title>Visualising Neighbouring Polygons in R</title>

      <description>A while back on StackOverflow, I answered a question on how to produce a map which showed how many polygons away a location was from another. This blog provides an update on how this can be used, with some slight tweaks to the answer to expand on the original. A lot of this content is based around the original from Roger Bivand here.
SetupIn order to calculate neighbouring polygons, we need to form a network of nodes for the data.</description>

      <title>Creating Twitter Wordclouds in R</title>

      <description>I recently finished my PhD, and my supervisor, Patrick James, always described me as a “data monster” in reference to how much I enjoyed playing with data. He was a massive influence throughout my PhD, so I felt it was only appropriate to get him a data-related gift when I finished. To this effect, I made him a wordcloud of all his tweet history!
This blog post explains how we can interact with Twitter data in R using the rtweet (Kearney 2018) package, and convert this raw data into pretty visualisations using the wordcloud2 (Lang 2018) package.</description>

      <title>Animated Plots with R</title>

      <description>Data scientists are blessed with a range of software tools which they can use to visualise results, and provide loads of great ways to present data which is equally informative and visually compelling. The increasing popularity of R ggplot2 (Wickham et al. 2018) has made many people familiar with static plots, but animated plots can be an effective way to communicate results, and there are few better examples than the use of them in the now famous TED talk by Hans Rosling.</description>

      <description>I have been delaying it for a while, but I finally decided to move to blogdown. This post is designed to quickly capture my reasons for me changing, and highlight some of the features that may make you consider doing the same.
Note: this post does not intend to be a full tutorial on how to set up your blog.</description>

      <description>knitr::opts_chunk$set(eval=FALSE)For my PhD research, I needed to collect local political data for the UK. This article documents the data sources and procedure used to create a suitable dataset for my analysis. This provides a technical overview of the data. The R code used to create the analysis is available through GitHub here.
SetupR was used to run the analysis. The code uses a number of packages to process the data:</description>

      <description>RMarkdown is a powerful tool for producing documents with embedded R code, allowing you to easily reproduce analysis and greatly simplify your data-driven workflow. It can be used to generate dynamic reports, presentations, journal papers, and even your thesis!
The presentation was designed to provide a whistle-stop tour of the benefits of RMarkdown, explaining the basic syntax to get started and highlighting some of the more advance things which you could use RMarkdown for.</description>

      <description>IntroAlthough R is widely used for data processing and statistical modelling, it is less frequently known for its powers of handing Geospatial Data. This presentation is aimed to highlgiht why people may want to consider using R for their GIS, and highlight some of the benefits of using R in their analyses.
Why use R for GISThere are many benefits of using R for GIS, but to me the top three reasons would be:</description>

      <description>I had the pleasure of presenting my work at the ECOS 2017 conference in San Diego, California. This page summarises the work and findings, with the research paper providing a more detailed decription.

What is the problem?Wind energy provides a key opportunity for the UK government to meet decarbonisation targets. There is wide avaialbility of resource across the country, and onshore wind provides one of the most mature and cost-effective methods to supply renewable electricity.</description>
