      <description>On Saturday 8th September 2017, I attempted to walk from London to Southampton as part of a charity fundraising event for Cameroon Catalyst. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the whole route, as I had to withdraw due to injury at the 50 mile mark at Basingstoke, but it was an overall fantastic experience which I was proud to undertake.
This blog post aims to capture the enjoyment and pain of undertaking the challenge!</description>

      <description>Back in May 2016, a friend and I undertook one of the challenges which we had wanted to do for years and cycled the length of the United Kingdom from Land’s End to John O’ Groats. It was a fantastic experience and something I would love to do again one day. This blog provides a summary of our trip and aims to aid anyone who may be planning their own trip.</description>
